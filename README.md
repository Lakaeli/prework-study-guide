# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to introduce myself to the following concepts; HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

Each subject contains bulleted summary notes, as a reference.

The friendly reminder ( h2 ) of "Open the Console to see what's happening", is there in case I get stuck, but also as a best practice.

## Usage

To be used as a study guide reference for the online 2023 Bootcamp Coding course.

The friendly reminder ( h2 ) of "Open the Console to see what's happening", is there in case I get stuck, but also as a best practice. --> Opening the console allows me to see what is going on with JavaScript, and to see if any errors are present. It will also list the topics I learned from the Prework.
